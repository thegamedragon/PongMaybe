# PongMaybe

A little SDL project: the classic game named 'Pong'.
This was more of a learning exercise and therefore i will not offer any support for it.
There are many improvements that can be made to the game, however they are mostly game-related and not SDL-related. The scope of this little project was to just get accustomed to SDL.

Everything that you can see in the repo is available 'as is' with no guarantees. You may do anything with it, including using it for personal and commercial purposes.
